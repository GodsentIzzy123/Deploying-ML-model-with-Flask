# Iris Flower Classification

In this section, we have used a simple RandomForestClassifier to classify the flowers into three groups

Creating the flask API

```
app = Flask("__name__")
```

The loadPage method calls our home.html.
```
@app.route("/")
def loadPage():
	return render_template('home.html', query="")
```

The Prediction method is our POST method, which is basically called when we pass all the inputs from our front end and click SUBMIT.
```
@app.route("/", methods=['POST'])
def IrisPrediction():
```
  
The run() method of Flask class runs the application on the local development server.
```
app.run()
```


Yay, our first model is ready, letâ€™s test our bot.
The above given Python script is executed from VS code.

Go to the VScode terminal and run the below query.
```
python app.py
```


Below message in Python shell is seen, which indicates that our App is now hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000
```
